      "With 3 years of experience at Techbeez, I developed a Restaurant Application, a full-stack Spring Boot and Angular application using a microservices architecture to streamline inventory, reporting, payroll, and HR. I enhanced system integration with RESTful APIs and boosted security through Okta for Single Sign-On. Implementing Apache Kafka allowed real-time order processing, while SQL Server optimizations improved performance. Using Redis for caching reduced database load, and comprehensive unit and integration tests ensured 95% code coverage. I led Git collaboration for over 10 developers, automated deployments on GCP with Jenkins, and integrated SonarQube for continuous code quality monitoring. My efforts in agile practices accelerated product delivery and optimized project timelines.",

      "At CCBP, I honed my skills in building full-stack web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). While undergoing this intensive training, I actively participated in competitive programming, further solidifying my problem-solving abilities.To demonstrate my newfound skills, I embarked on personal projects, including developing static websites and dynamic web applications. One such project was a Jobby application, inspired by LinkedIn. This project involved building 8-10 API routes to handle functionalities like user authentication, job postings, and searches.",
