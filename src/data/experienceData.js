      "At Pratian Technologies, I played a key role in developing an application called Restaurant One Solution. I was responsible for designing and implementing APIs for various functionalities, including Inventory Management, Payroll Processing, and HR Management. This involved creating robust data models and effectively mapping them to the application's needs. To ensure a modular and scalable architecture, I leveraged microservices principles and utilized Eureka Server for service discovery. I actively participated in testing the developed APIs using Postman and Swagger UI, guaranteeing their functionality and reliability.My development stack included Spring Boot for building the application backend and PostgreSQL for persistent data storage. Agile methodologies were adopted throughout the development lifecycle, allowing for flexible and iterative development cycles. Additionally, I contributed by writing unit test cases to ensure code quality and maintainability.Being part of a startup environment presented a unique opportunity. As a member of a small team, I actively participated in creating Docker containers for deployment and explored the use of Kubernetes for container orchestration. Moreover, I gained valuable experience in utilizing tools to assess code quality, further enhancing the overall application's robustness.",
